SECTION 1: RISK ASSESSMENT SAMPLE
================================================================================

Risk Assessment Document

Risk ID: RISK-2025-001
Risk Description: Potential data security breach due to inadequate encryption protocols in the new authentication system implementation.

Severity: High
Status: Open
Risk Owner: John Smith (Security Lead)
Date Identified: June 20, 2025

Mitigation Plan: 
1. Implement industry-standard encryption protocols (AES-256)
2. Conduct security audit by third-party vendor
3. Implement multi-factor authentication
4. Regular security training for development team
5. Establish incident response plan

Relevant Notes:
- This risk was identified during the sprint planning phase
- The authentication system is critical for user data protection
- Compliance requirements mandate specific security measures
- Budget allocation of $50,000 approved for security enhancements

SECTION 2: SPRINT PLANNING SAMPLE (LLM-Generated Format)
================================================================================

Sprint Planning Document

Sprint Overview:
Sprint Number: Sprint 7
Sprint Dates: June 23, 2025 - July 4, 2025
Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
Team Name: Innovators Team
Sprint Goal: Deliver user authentication feature and improve system performance

Team Capacity:
Total Hours Per Person: 80 hours
Daily Productive Hours: 6 hours
Historical Story Points: 25 points per sprint

Team Members:
- Developer A (Developer): 72 hours
- Developer B (Developer): 80 hours
- QA Engineer C (QA Engineer): 64 hours
- UX Designer D (UX Designer): 40 hours
- DevOps Engineer E (DevOps Engineer): 20 hours
- Scrum Master F (Scrum Master): 80 hours
- Product Owner G (Product Owner): 80 hours

Product Backlog:
1. CPQ-1: Ability to manage the lifecycle of the product. The product status must support three stages: Active, End of New Sale, and Inactive.
   Acceptance Criteria:
   - 3 Status/Stages: Active, End of Sale & Inactive
   - Effective date and Expiration date field (use OOTB)
   - End of New sales products should only be for renewal or add-on
   - Active Products should be available for all transactions
   - Inactive products should not be available for all transactions
   Priority: High
   Effort Estimate: 14 hours

2. CPQ-065: Ability to consolidate pricelists by inactivating price lists not used in the past 4 years and by defining pricing rules for professional services PLIs.
   Acceptance Criteria:
   - Deactivate everything on the "Deactivation List Tab" in Price List Analysis.xlsx
   - Consolidation of price lists incl. for Professional Services price lists, based on price rules identified
   Priority: Medium
   Effort Estimate: 10 hours

3. CPQ-118: Rationalization of opportunity record types to match only the two existing sales processes of new sales and renewals. Renewals opportunities will include add-ons also.
   Acceptance Criteria:
   - When editing quote lines in the cart, the user can select the following adjustment types and apply either a percent or amount to the price, per the discount waterfall: % Discount, Discount Amount, % Markup, Markup Amount, Price Override, % Uplift
   - If there is a partner involved and the band is applied to the list price already, the markup% and markup amount would increase the already descreased price, not list price, however the OOTB functionality works
   Priority: Medium
   Effort Estimate: 20 hours

Definition of Done:
- Code committed and peer-reviewed
- Unit tests passing ≥80% coverage
- Integration tests passing
- QA tested and signed off (all Acceptance Criteria met)
- Deployed to Staging environment
- Relevant documentation (e.g., Confluence, API docs) updated
- Product Owner accepted

Risks and Impediments:
- Developer A absence for 1 day on 25-06-2025
- DevOps Engineer E is a shared resource
- Potential delay in obtaining new database credentials for performance testing environment
